  Consider the following pseudo-code:

  #+BEGIN_SRC
f = 8
f = 4*x
  #+END_SRC

  What is =x=?

  Most programmers will probably say that =x= is unknown.
  But anyone else will tell you that =x= is obviously 2.
  
  MetaPost will tell you the same.

  This allows you to write code in a rather different manner than most other programming languages.
  It makes it a joy to use MetaPost to illustrate geometrical relationships.
  MetaPost is generally a fun language and a great way to produce high quality illustrations.

  Unfortunately the novel style can also make it a little difficult to get started.
  MetaPost has a great [[https://www.tug.org/docs/metapost/mpman.pdf][manual]], but not so many tutorials.
  So I wrote a small course that walks the complete novice through all the steps from installation to the successfull
  production of images like the one below. Check it out at [[http://www.learnmetapost.com][LearnMetaPost.com]].
